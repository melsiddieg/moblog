It operates on an “artist’s palette” model, where you start with a blank canvas using high-level functions like plot() to create the initial plot, and then incrementally add elements such as points, lines, and text with low-level functions like points(), lines(), and text() . This layered approach allows for detailed customization of plots, enabling users to adjust various aspects such as axes, labels, colors, and symbols to suit their specific needs .
