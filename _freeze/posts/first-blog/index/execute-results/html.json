It operates on an \"artist's palette\" model, where you start with a blank canvas using high-level functions like `plot()` to create the initial plot, and then incrementally add elements such as points, lines, and text with low-level functions like `points()`, `lines()`, and `text()` . This layered approach allows for detailed customization of plots, enabling users to adjust various aspects such as axes, labels, colors, and symbols to suit their specific needs . While base R plotting may require more manual adjustments compared to newer systems like `ggplot2`, it remains a powerful tool for creating a wide range of static graphics, from simple scatter plots to complex multi-panel figures\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1:50\ny <- x^2\nplot(x,y,col='darkgreen',pch=20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
