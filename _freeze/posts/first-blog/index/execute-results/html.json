While base R plotting may require more manual adjustments compared to newer systems like `ggplot2`, it remains a powerful tool for creating a wide range of static graphics, from simple scatter plots to complex multi-panel figures\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1:50\ny <- x^2\nplot(x,y,col='darkgreen',pch=20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
